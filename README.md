# CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE-PREDICTIONUSING-BINARY-CLASSIFICATIONAND-GENETIC-ALGORITHM

Cardiovascular diseases are those diseases that are related to heart .Heart 
diseases are not short term diseases like fever or cold. They take years of time to 
diagnose and are hardto detect and predict based on symptoms. It is a major 
cause of morbidity and transience in the modern society . Diagnosis of 
cardiovascular disease using various medical tests is animportant but 
complicated task which should be performed accurately. If there are any errors or 
mistakes in those predictions , the life of patient might be in danger. Hence a
Powerful tool in the prediction of heart disease with lower cost has Become the 
need of time. Detection of such cardiovascular i.e heart diseases might be done 
with the help of some common symptoms like regular illness or even be 
predicted using risk factors such as age, family history , diabetes ,hypertension 
,high cholesterol, tobacco smoking, alcohol intake ,obesity or physical in-activity 
,etc. A very scarce number of the systems predict heart diseases based on these 
risk factors. Heart disease patients have lot of these visible risk Factors in 
common which can be used very effectively for diagnosis. System based on such 
risk factors would not only help medical Professionals but it would give patients 
a warning about the probable Presence of heart disease even before he visits a 
hospital. In this, we will Apply ANN and binary classification to the datasets 
which is nothing but the risk factors, for Prediction and training of network .
